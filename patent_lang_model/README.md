## Containerization setup
We use Docker for containerization. Since we are building a Streamlit application, we can expect to be developing solely in Python. The Docker base image we are building our container from is `python:3.10-slim`.

[Reference for deploying Streamlit application in Docker](https://docs.streamlit.io/knowledge-base/tutorials/deploy/docker)

We then use VS Code Dev Containers to allow us to create a Docker image from the Dockerfile and develop inside of a Docker container. 

[Reference for setting up VS Code Dev Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/create-dev-container#_dockerfile)

Our container configuration will be set up as such:
```
└── patent_lang_model
    └── .devcontainer
        ├── devcontainer.json
        └── Dockerfile
```
